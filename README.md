#12 coins

Given:

* 11 coins of identical weight
* 1 coin of a different relative weight
* a set of scales
* a maximum of 3 weighings

Decide which coin has the different weight and whether that weight is less than or greater than the weight
of any of the other 11 coins.

The decide() function is a go-lang solution to this problem. When compiled and executed, the program tests
that function against all 24 possible configurations.
